<span id="Should-I-use-Gforth-extensions_003f"></span><h2 class="chapter">10 Should I use Gforth extensions?</h2>
<span id="index-Gforth-extensions"></span>

<p>As you read through the rest of this manual, you will see documentation for
<i>Standard</i> words, and documentation for some appealing Gforth
<i>extensions</i>. You might ask yourself the question: <i>&ldquo;Should I restrict
myself to the standard, or should I use the extensions?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>The answer depends on the goals you have for the program you are working on:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Is it just for yourself or do you want to share it with others?

</li><li> If you want to share it, do the others all use Gforth?

</li><li> If it is just for yourself, do you want to restrict yourself to Gforth?

</li></ul>

<p>If restricting the program to Gforth is ok, then there is no reason not to
use extensions.  It is still a good idea to keep to the standard where it is
easy, in case you want to reuse these parts in another program that you want
to be portable.
</p>
<p>If you want to be able to port the program to other Forth systems, there are
the following points to consider:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Most Forth systems that are being maintained support Standard Forth.  So if
your program complies with the standard, it will be portable among many
systems.

</li><li> A number of the Gforth extensions can be implemented in Standard Forth using
public-domain files provided in the <samp>compat/</samp> directory. These are
mentioned in the text in passing.  There is no reason not to use these
extensions, your program will still be Standard Forth compliant; just
include the appropriate compat files with your program.

</li><li> The tool <samp>ans-report.fs</samp> (see <a href="Standard-Report.html"><samp>ans-report.fs</samp>: Report the words used, sorted by wordset</a>) makes it easy to
analyse your program and determine what non-Standard words it relies upon.
However, it does not check whether you use standard words in a non-standard
way.

</li><li> Some techniques are not standardized by Standard Forth, and are hard or
impossible to implement in a standard way, but can be implemented in most
Forth systems easily, and usually in similar ways (e.g., accessing word
headers).  Forth has a rich historical precedent for programmers taking
advantage of implementation-dependent features of their tools (for example,
relying on a knowledge of the dictionary structure). Sometimes these
techniques are necessary to extract every last bit of performance from the
hardware, sometimes they are just a programming shorthand.

</li><li> Does using a Gforth extension save more work than the porting this part to
other Forth systems (if any) will cost?

</li><li> Is the additional functionality worth the reduction in portability and the
additional porting problems?

</li></ul>

<p>In order to perform these considerations, you need to know what&rsquo;s standard
and what&rsquo;s not.  This manual generally states if something is non-standard,
but the authoritative source is the
<a href="https://forth-standard.org/standard/words">standard document</a>.
Appendix A of the Standard (<var>Rationale</var>) provides a valuable insight
into the thought processes of the technical committee.
</p>
<p>Note also that portability between Forth systems is not the only portability
issue; there is also the issue of portability between different platforms
(processor/OS combinations).
