<span id="index-locals-visibility"></span>
<span id="index-visibility-of-locals"></span>
<span id="index-scope-of-locals"></span>

<p>Basically, the answer is that locals are visible where you would expect it
in block-structured languages, and sometimes a little longer. If you want to
restrict the scope of a local, enclose its definition in
<code>SCOPE</code>...<code>ENDSCOPE</code>.
</p>

<span id="index-scope-_0028--compilation-_002d_002d-scope-_003b-run_002dtime-_002d_002d--_0029-gforth_002d0_002e2"></span>
<span id="index-scope"></span>
<span id="index-scope-1"></span>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><code>scope</code> ( <i>compilation  &ndash; scope ; run-time  &ndash;  </i>) gforth-0.2 &ldquo;scope&rdquo;
</pre></div>

<span id="index-endscope-_0028--compilation-scope-_002d_002d-_003b-run_002dtime-_002d_002d--_0029-gforth_002d0_002e2"></span>
<span id="index-endscope"></span>
<span id="index-endscope-1"></span>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><code>endscope</code> ( <i>compilation scope &ndash; ; run-time  &ndash;  </i>) gforth-0.2 &ldquo;endscope&rdquo;
</pre></div>



<p>These words behave like control structure words, so you can use them with
<code>CS-PICK</code> and <code>CS-ROLL</code> to restrict the scope in arbitrary ways.
</p>
<p>If you want a more exact answer to the visibility question, here&rsquo;s the basic
principle: A local is visible in all places that can only be reached through
the definition of the local<a id="DOCF30" href="#FOOT30"><sup>30</sup></a>. In other words, it is
not visible in places that can be reached without going through the
definition of the local. E.g., locals defined in <code>IF</code>...<code>ENDIF</code>
are visible until the <code>ENDIF</code>, locals defined in
<code>BEGIN</code>...<code>UNTIL</code> are visible after the <code>UNTIL</code> (until, e.g.,
a subsequent <code>ENDSCOPE</code>).
</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this solution is: We want to have the locals visible as
long as it is meaningful. The user can always make the visibility shorter by
using explicit scoping. In a place that can only be reached through the
definition of a local, the meaning of a local name is clear. In other places
it is not: How is the local initialized at the control flow path that does
not contain the definition? Which local is meant, if the same name is
defined twice in two independent control flow paths?
</p>
<p>This should be enough detail for nearly all users, so you can skip the rest
of this section. If you really must know all the gory details and options,
read on.
</p>
<p>In order to implement this rule, the compiler has to know which places are
unreachable. It knows this automatically after <code>AHEAD</code>, <code>AGAIN</code>,
<code>EXIT</code> and <code>LEAVE</code>; in other cases (e.g., after most
<code>THROW</code>s), you can use the word <code>UNREACHABLE</code> to tell the compiler
that the control flow never reaches that place. If <code>UNREACHABLE</code> is not
used where it could, the only consequence is that the visibility of some
locals is more limited than the rule above says. If <code>UNREACHABLE</code> is
used where it should not (i.e., if you lie to the compiler), buggy code will
be produced.
</p>

<span id="index-UNREACHABLE-_0028--_002d_002d--_0029-gforth_002d0_002e2"></span>
<span id="index-UNREACHABLE"></span>
<span id="index-UNREACHABLE-1"></span>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><code>UNREACHABLE</code> ( <i>&ndash;  </i>) gforth-0.2 &ldquo;UNREACHABLE&rdquo;
</pre></div>



<p>Another problem with this rule is that at <code>BEGIN</code>, the compiler does
not know which locals will be visible on the incoming back-edge. All
problems discussed in the following are due to this ignorance of the
compiler (we discuss the problems using <code>BEGIN</code> loops as examples; the
discussion also applies to <code>?DO</code> and other loops). Perhaps the most
insidious example is:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">AHEAD
BEGIN
  x
[ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
  {: x :}
  ...
UNTIL
</pre></div>

<p>This should be legal according to the visibility rule. The use of <code>x</code>
can only be reached through the definition; but that appears textually below
the use.
</p>
<p>From this example it is clear that the visibility rules cannot be fully
implemented without major headaches. Our implementation treats common cases
as advertised and the exceptions are treated in a safe way: The compiler
makes a reasonable guess about the locals visible after a <code>BEGIN</code>; if
it is too pessimistic, the user will get a spurious error about the local
not being defined; if the compiler is too optimistic, it will notice this
later and issue a warning. In the case above the compiler would complain
about <code>x</code> being undefined at its use. You can see from the obscure
examples in this section that it takes quite unusual control structures to
get the compiler into trouble, and even then it will often do fine.
</p>
<p>If the <code>BEGIN</code> is reachable from above, the most optimistic guess is
that all locals visible before the <code>BEGIN</code> will also be visible after
the <code>BEGIN</code>. This guess is valid for all loops that are entered only
through the <code>BEGIN</code>, in particular, for normal
<code>BEGIN</code>...<code>WHILE</code>...<code>REPEAT</code> and <code>BEGIN</code>...<code>UNTIL</code>
loops and it is implemented in our compiler. When the branch to the
<code>BEGIN</code> is finally generated by <code>AGAIN</code> or <code>UNTIL</code>, the
compiler checks the guess and warns the user if it was too optimistic:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">IF
  {: x :}
BEGIN
  \ x ? 
[ 1 cs-roll ] THEN
  ...
UNTIL
</pre></div>

<p>Here, <code>x</code> lives only until the <code>BEGIN</code>, but the compiler
optimistically assumes that it lives until the <code>THEN</code>. It notices this
difference when it compiles the <code>UNTIL</code> and issues a warning. The user
can avoid the warning, and make sure that <code>x</code> is not used in the wrong
area by using explicit scoping:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">IF
  SCOPE
  {: x :}
  ENDSCOPE
BEGIN
[ 1 cs-roll ] THEN
  ...
UNTIL
</pre></div>

<p>Since the guess is optimistic, there will be no spurious error messages
about undefined locals.
</p>
<p>If the <code>BEGIN</code> is not reachable from above (e.g., after <code>AHEAD</code> or
<code>EXIT</code>), the compiler cannot even make an optimistic guess, as the
locals visible after the <code>BEGIN</code> may be defined later.
</p>
<p>It pessimistically assumes that all locals are visible that were visible at
the latest place outside any control structure (i.e., where nothing is on
the control-flow stack).  This means that in:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">: foo
  IF {: z :} THEN
  {: x :}
  AHEAD
    BEGIN
      ( * )
    [ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
    {: y :}
    ...
  UNTIL ;
</pre></div>

<p>At the place marked with <code>( * )</code>, <code>x</code> is visible, but <code>y</code> is
not (although, according to the reachability rule it should); <code>z</code> is
not and should not be visible there.
</p>
<p>However, you can use <code>ASSUME-LIVE</code> to make the compiler assume that the
same locals are visible at the BEGIN as at the point where the top
control-flow stack item was created.
</p>

<span id="index-ASSUME_002dLIVE-_0028--orig-_002d_002d-orig--_0029-gforth_002d0_002e2"></span>
<span id="index-ASSUME_002dLIVE"></span>
<span id="index-ASSUME_002dLIVE-1"></span>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><code>ASSUME-LIVE</code> ( <i>orig &ndash; orig  </i>) gforth-0.2 &ldquo;ASSUME-LIVE&rdquo;
</pre></div>



<p>例えば、 以下のように使います
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">IF
  {: x :}
  AHEAD
    ASSUME-LIVE
    BEGIN
      x
    [ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
    ...
  UNTIL
THEN
</pre></div>

<p>Here <code>x</code> would not be visible at the use of <code>x</code>, because its
definition is inside a control structure, but by using ASSUME-LIVE the
programmer tells the compiler that the locals visible at the <code>AHEAD</code>
should be visible at the <code>BEGIN</code>.
</p>
<p>Other cases where the locals are defined before the <code>BEGIN</code> can be
handled by inserting an appropriate <code>CS-ROLL</code> before the
<code>ASSUME-LIVE</code> (and changing the control-flow stack manipulation behind
the <code>ASSUME-LIVE</code>).
</p>
<p>Cases where locals are defined after the <code>BEGIN</code> (but should be visible
immediately after the <code>BEGIN</code>) can only be handled by rearranging the
loop. E.g., the &ldquo;most insidious&rdquo; example above can be arranged into:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">BEGIN
  {: x :}
  ... 0=
WHILE
  x
REPEAT
</pre></div>
