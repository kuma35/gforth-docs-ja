<p>We have a number of ideas for future versions of Vmgen.  However, there are
so many possible things to do that we would like some feedback from you.
What are you doing with Vmgen, what features are you missing, and why?
</p>
<p>One idea we are thinking about is to generate just one <samp class="file">.c</samp> file
instead of letting you copy and adapt all the wrapper files (you would still
have to define stuff like the type-specific macros, and stack pointers
etc. somewhere).  The advantage would be that, if we change the wrapper
files between versions, you would not need to integrate your changes and our
changes to them; Vmgen would also be easier to use for beginners.  The main
disadvantage of that is that it would reduce the flexibility of Vmgen a
little (well, those who like flexibility could still patch the resulting
<samp class="file">.c</samp> file, like they are now doing for the wrapper files).  In any
case, if you are doing things to the wrapper files that would cause problems
in a generated-<samp class="file">.c</samp>-file approach, please let us know.
