<p>Gforth consists not only of primitives (in the engine), but also of
definitions written in Forth. Since the Forth compiler itself belongs to
those definitions, it is not possible to start the system with the engine
and the Forth source alone. Therefore we provide the Forth code as an image
file in nearly executable form. When Gforth starts up, a C routine loads the
image file into memory, optionally relocates the addresses, then sets up the
memory (stacks etc.) according to information in the image file, and
(finally) starts executing Forth code.
</p>
<p>The default image file is <samp>gforth.fi</samp> (in the <code>GFORTHPATH</code>).  You
can use a different image by using the <code>-i</code>, <code>--image-file</code> or
<code>--appl-image</code> options (see <a href="Invoking-Gforth.html">Invoking Gforth</a>), e.g.:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">gforth-fast -i myimage.fi
</pre></div>

<p>There are different variants of image files, and they represent different
compromises between the goals of making it easy to generate image files and
making them portable.
</p>
<span id="index-relocation-at-run_002dtime"></span>
<p>Win32Forth 3.4 and Mitch Bradley&rsquo;s <code>cforth</code> use relocation at
run-time. This avoids many of the complications discussed below (image files
are data relocatable without further ado), but costs performance (one
addition per memory access) and makes it difficult to pass addresses between
Forth and library calls or other programs.
</p>
<span id="index-relocation-at-load_002dtime"></span>
<p>By contrast, the Gforth loader performs relocation at image load time. The
loader also has to replace tokens that represent primitive calls with the
appropriate code-field addresses (or code addresses in the case of direct
threading).
</p>
<p>There are three kinds of image files, with different degrees of
relocatability: non-relocatable, data-relocatable, and fully relocatable
image files.
</p>
<span id="index-image-file-loader"></span>
<span id="index-relocating-loader"></span>
<span id="index-loader-for-image-files"></span>
<p>These image file variants have several restrictions in common; they are
caused by the design of the image file loader:
</p>
<ul>
<li> There is only one segment; in particular, this means, that an image file
cannot represent <code>ALLOCATE</code>d memory chunks (and pointers to them). The
contents of the stacks are not represented, either.

</li><li> The only kinds of relocation supported are: adding the same offset to all
cells that represent data addresses; and replacing special tokens with code
addresses or with pieces of machine code.

<p>If any complex computations involving addresses are performed, the results
cannot be represented in the image file. Several applications that use such
computations come to mind:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- Hashing addresses (or data structures which contain addresses) for table
lookup. If you use Gforth&rsquo;s <code>table</code>s or <code>wordlist</code>s for this
purpose, you will have no problem, because the hash tables are recomputed
automatically when the system is started. If you use your own hash tables,
you will have to do something similar.

</li><li>- There&rsquo;s a cute implementation of doubly-linked lists that uses <code>XOR</code>ed
addresses. You could represent such lists as singly-linked in the image
file, and restore the doubly-linked representation on startup.<a id="DOCF36" href="#FOOT36"><sup>36</sup></a>

</li><li>- The code addresses of run-time routines like <code>docol:</code> cannot be
represented in the image file (because their tokens would be replaced by
machine code in direct threaded implementations). As a workaround, compute
these addresses at run-time with <code>&gt;code-address</code> from the executions
tokens of appropriate words (see the definitions of <code>docol:</code> and
friends in <samp>kernel/getdoers.fs</samp>).

</li><li>- On many architectures addresses are represented in machine code in some
shifted or mangled form. You cannot put <code>CODE</code> words that contain
absolute addresses in this form in a relocatable image file. Workarounds are
representing the address in some relative form (e.g., relative to the CFA,
which is present in some register), or loading the address from a place
where it is stored in a non-mangled form.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>In
my opinion, though, you should think thrice before using a doubly-linked
list (whatever implementation).</p>
