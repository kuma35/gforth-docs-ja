<p>The Gforth project was started in mid-1992 by Bernd Paysan and Anton
Ertl. The third major author was Jens Wilke.  Neal Crook contributed a lot
to the manual.  Assemblers and disassemblers were contributed by Andrew
McKewan, Christian Pirker, Bernd Thallner, and Michal Revucky.  Lennart
Benschop (who was one of Gforth&rsquo;s first users, in mid-1993)  and Stuart
Ramsden inspired us with their continuous feedback. Lennart Benshop
contributed <samp>glosgen.fs</samp>, while Stuart Ramsden has been working on
automatic support for calling C libraries. Helpful comments also came from
Paul Kleinrubatscher, Christian Pirker, Dirk Zoller, Marcel Hendrix, John
Wavrik, Barrie Stott, Marc de Groot, Jorge Acerada, Bruce Hoyt, Robert
Epprecht, Dennis Ruffer and David N. Williams. Since the release of
Gforth-0.2.1 there were also helpful comments from many others; thank you
all, sorry for not listing you here (but digging through my mailbox to
extract your names is on my to-do list).
</p>
<p>Gforth also owes a lot to the authors of the tools we used (GCC, CVS, and
autoconf, among others), and to the creators of the Internet: Gforth was
developed across the Internet, and its authors did not meet physically for
the first 4 years of development.

<span id="index-pedigree-of-Gforth"></span>

<p>Gforth descends from bigFORTH (1993) and fig-Forth.  Of course, a
significant part of the design of Gforth was prescribed by Standard Forth.
</p>
<p>Bernd Paysan wrote bigFORTH, a descendent from TurboForth, an unreleased 32
bit native code version of VolksForth for the Atari ST, written mostly by
Dietrich Weineck.
</p>
<p>VolksForth was written by Klaus Schleisiek, Bernd Pennemann, Georg Rehfeld
and Dietrich Weineck for the C64 (called UltraForth there) in the mid-80s
and ported to the Atari ST in 1986.  It descends from fig-Forth.
</p>

<p>A team led by Bill Ragsdale implemented fig-Forth on many processors in
1979. Robert Selzer and Bill Ragsdale developed the original implementation
of fig-Forth for the 6502 based on microForth.
</p>
<p>The principal architect of microForth was Dean Sanderson. microForth was
FORTH, Inc.&rsquo;s first off-the-shelf product. It was developed in 1976 for the
1802, and subsequently implemented on the 8080, the 6800 and the Z80.
</p>
<p>All earlier Forth systems were custom-made, usually by Charles Moore, who
discovered (as he puts it) Forth during the late 60s. The first full Forth
existed in 1971.
</p>
<p>A part of the information in this section comes from
<cite><a href="https://www.forth.com/resources/evolution/index.html">The
Evolution of Forth</a></cite> by Elizabeth D. Rather, Donald R. Colburn and Charles
H. Moore, presented at the HOPL-II conference and preprinted in SIGPLAN
Notices 28(3), 1993.  You can find more historical and genealogical
information about Forth there.  For a more general (and graphical) Forth
family tree look see

Family Tree and Timeline</cite>.
